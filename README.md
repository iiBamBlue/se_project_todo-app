## Simple Todo App

A simple and user-friendly Todo application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The app features form validation, unique IDs for tasks, and the ability to add and delete todos.

## Functionality

Add Todo: Users can add new todos by filling out a form with a task name and an optional due date. The form is validated to ensure the task name is provided.

Delete Todo: Users can delete existing todos by clicking the delete button associated with each todo item.

Form Validation: The app uses a FormValidator class to handle form validation, ensuring that the form inputs are valid before allowing submission.

Unique IDs: Each todo item is assigned a unique ID using the uuid package, ensuring that each task can be uniquely identified.

## Technology

JavaScript (ES6+): The app is written in modern JavaScript, leveraging features such as classes and modules.

HTML & CSS: The user interface is built using HTML and CSS.

UUID: The uuid package is used to generate unique IDs for each todo item.

Modular Structure: The project is organized into modules, with separate files for components (Todo and FormValidator) and utility functions (constants).

Here are some screenshots demonstrating the features of the app: WIP
